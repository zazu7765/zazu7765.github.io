          <p>
            Hi! My name is Daniel, and I'm a grade 12 student at University of Toronto Schools.
            I enjoy coding for a purpose, especially if it's something I'm interested in.
            I've worked on many small projects, either for my own benefit or as a remote volunteer.<br><br>
            My hobbies include cycling, kayaking, chasing after my dog and playing video games!
            Right now I'm waiting on a new Trek Domane AL 2 and I've been playing a lot of Diablo II Resurrected!
          </p>

        <p class="project-description">This is my portfolio website (what you're on right now!).<br><br>Originally I tried making it with a css library (w3.css) but it kept me from properly understanding css layouts with flexbox, so I ended up scrapping it.<br><br>My second iteration of this website was a site where I tracked my favourite artists' latest singles and albums and, although it didn't look pretty, I was proud to have made it.<br><br>Right now, this website is a hub for my projects and an exercise on proper CSS.</p>

      <details class="project">
        <summary class="project-title"><h3>credit card checker</h3></summary>
        <p class="project-description">This was my first project with an actual algorithm (the Luhn algorithm) and was a lot of fun because it's a real-life application of the algorithm!<br><br>I suggest checking it out on my <a href="https://github.com/zazu7765/cc_checker_proj" target="_blank">github</a> since you can see a few of the credit card numbers I split into arrays and how the algorithm is implement using a for loop and if/else statements.</p>

        <summary class="project-title"><h3>robotics for all</h3></summary>
        <p class="project-description">I've worked a little bit on the Robotics for All website redesign that was done in React (preact and bootstrap with vite) and while it won't be done anytime soon, it's was a good learning experience with how to make an already-working website properly responsive.<br><br>I've also worked on small javascript applications that transmit data to and from slack/google sheets! One of these displayed open classes and students while the other was a way to find substitute teachers for classes that were missing a teacher.</p>
